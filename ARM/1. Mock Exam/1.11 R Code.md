![Pasted image 20240124001637](Pasted%20image%2020240124001637.png)A **within-subjects design** (also known as a repeated-measures design) means the ===**same subjects are exposed to all conditions or treatments**===. This design is beneficial for controlling for individual differences as each participant acts as their own control.

A **between-subjects design** (also known as an independent measures design) means **==different subjects are used for each condition or treatment==**. This requires a larger sample size but avoids issues like order effects that can affect within-subjects designs.

The research involving Johnny and Mandy robots in different dealerships appears to be a **between-subjects design**, as it seems that different participants encountered the robots in each condition, rather than the same participants experiencing all conditions.
