This is a challenging course because it covers a lot of topics that are not very closely related to what we previously learned. Also, the final exam was way more challenging compared with the mock exam (which, I have learned during the past year, is a very Dutch feature that everyone should get used to as soon as possible), for it had more questions and involved more topics. 

I have summarized two tips to pass the exam.
1. Memorize the images in the slides. Many questions gave you an incomplete images and ask you to put words or phrases in the correct positions in the images.
2. Plan your time to complete all questions. As soon as you get the questions, divide the total time by the number of questions, and check the time frequently during the exam. Don't spend too much time on questions you are uncertain about. Just write down something that you think makes sense, mark the question, and return to it later.

Good luck! 🙏💯
